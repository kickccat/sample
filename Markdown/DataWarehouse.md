# Key Charactristics of a Data Warehouse

- Data is structured for simplicity of access and high-speed query performance.
- End users are time-sensitive and desire speed-of-thought response times.
- Large amounts of historical data are used.
- Queries often retrieve large amounts of data, perhaps many thousands of rows.
- Both predefined and ad hoc queries are common.
- The data load involves multiple sources and transformations.
